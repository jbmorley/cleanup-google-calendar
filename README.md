# cleanup-google-calendar

This script serves a very specific personal need. It looks for all the UIDs in an ICS file and deletes any corresponding entries in a Google Calendar. It's designed to undo a failed / partial Google Calendar ICS import without destroying any data which may have been present in the Google Calendar prior to the import.
